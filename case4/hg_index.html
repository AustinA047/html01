                                    that bring people together through shared <br /> experiences. With 
                                    all due respect to our video gamer friends, you can't always get
                                    that from a computer<br /> screen. Sometimes you need the 
                                    intimate approach of sitting face-to-face around 
                                    a common table with the soda and chips at your elbow.</p></blockquote>

                                    <blockquote><p>We are a local board and card game store located in the 
                                    heart of Morgantown near the campus.<br /> We carry 
                                    hundreds of games and puzzles, including educational games, family games, card games,<br /> historical 
                                    simulations, role-playing games, and so much more. 
                                    If you remember a great game from <br />your youth, we 
                                    probably have it in our antiques collection. If we don't, we know where we can get it.</p></blockquote>

                                    gaming and the company of good friends. <br />
                                    Our game room is free for all to us. Sit down, pick out 
                                    a game from our demo library and start playing. <br />
                                    We sponsor tournaments, challenges, and special 
                                    social events. You'll always find a game to play.</p></blockquote>
